## Project Summary
The debts connection among a group of friends can be quite complex, due to occasions like eating, movies, etc. and one person pays everything and others will repay later. DebNet helps manage this connections by summarizing the total amount of money, memorizing the events and listing the debts. Furthermore, DebNet has unique user profile where statistics (e.g. number of transactions) are showed.

## Prototype
The project is built as an mobile app, and unfortunately we can't export the project to a web version. Please download the apk file to your phone and install it to test the prototype. Sorry for the inconvenience.

*Please let us know if there is any version problem. We have tested it on several phones and it worked fine, however we are not absolutely sure that it will work properly on your phone.*

## Libraries and Frameworks
The high-fi prototype was built by using a mobile app SDK called **Flutter**. Flutter provides an easy way to build beautiful native apps by using it high level libraries, consisting of numerous widgets.
Flutter uses Dart language, an object-oriented language similar to Java.

## Individual Reflections
1. **Viet Do**
    - **Contribution**: I built the 'fake' database where data are generated, defined database classes that are used in our implementation like 'user', 'event', 'notification', etc. I am also responsible for synchronizing the data into the frontend part, so that 
    - **Difficulties**: It is my first time bulding a mobile app, and 
    - **Most useful skill learned**: While building the prototype, the most valuable skill I obtained is defining the database for a project. In our project, I have to consider carefully which classes should be build and how can one affects another.
